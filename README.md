I've divide everything into files to be more organized

# how to run your solution :

just open products.html file

### `JS file`

i used Vanilla JS and DOM Manipulation to build this page without any framework as per your requirement

i added all logic into this file

### `HTML file`

i added the initial html elements to this page and you can open it just click on it

### `css file`

i added all css into this file
### `Roboto-Regular file`

i added this file for font-family

# challenges faced :

Use the same logic to display data whether it is products or categories

Use dom with its limitations to do the same work as any framework

I've sorted by code because the dummy API doesn't provide us with a sort

and for your information there is no pagination when sorting only
# improvements :

I need to add a loader before the page is initialized before the data arrives

I need to split the js code into modules to be more organized but this will need more time
